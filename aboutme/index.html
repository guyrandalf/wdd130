      Hola in the calmest of ways :). As tall and almost-big as myself, nothing
      scares me more than "Write/Tell me about yourself". Anyways, I am from
      Nigeria and I have been a PHP Web developer for 6 years.
    </p>
    <p>
      Humbled by my Heavenly Father by the inability to have good color ideas to
      become a frontend developer, and ofcourse, with PHP, a full-stack
      developer, I enroled to learn and stay humble. My career path is to be a
      full-stack web and mobile apps developer.
    </p>
    <p>
      I love to code, cook (since i love to eat too), I love to play the piano
      and learn new stuff.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am currently into freelancing and pursuing a degree to improve my job
      opportunities. I have been a member of the church for 11 years. I am
      grateful to my Heavenly Father for the opportunities he provides for me
      through His church.
    </p>
    <p>I hope to learn and improve with everyone studying with me.</p>
